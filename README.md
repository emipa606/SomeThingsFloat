Let the river wash your trash away!

This mod lets things float in water and move with the stream. In non-streaming water things will move about at random. Things can leave the map this way so can be used to dispose of things you dont want, corpses for example.

There is a possibility that things spawn in the river that you can get use of, or even downed pawns you can choose to rescue. If [Allow Tool](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761421485) is active you can set all spawning items to be hauled urgently automatically. With Odyssey chunks can also spawn in space and land on your platforms.

There is also bars and nets that can be built in water. The bars can catch large objects like corpses, living pawns, weapons and apparel while the metal net can catch all items.

Pawns may also loose their footing in moving water. They can also drown if being downed in water. Certain apparel will prevent this, such as the power-armor helmet. Any headgear with the EVA-tag from SOS2 will be considered a breathable helmet. To avoid guests and pawns accidentally being swept away I suggest using [Clean Pathfinding 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2603765747) to make pawns prefer roads and bridges. Combine it with [Enter Here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824117092) to make pawns spawn in near roads.

If [SwimmingKit](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542399915) is loaded, pawns with higher swimspeed will float slower when downed. Also pawns with the Nimble trait will be half as likely to loose their footing. Aquatic animals from [Biomes! Islands](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038001322) or any animal using the Amphibious movement type from [Pathfinding Framework](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3070914628) will not loose their footing or drown.

Technically the mod looks at all items in water-tiles and calculates their floating value. This is based on what stuff is used to build the item, but some things like corpses have a default float value. Its also possible to add floatable-values to other things via patches, there is a patch for barrels of fecal-matter from [Dubs Bad Hygiene](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836308268) that can be used as an example. Higher floatable values makes things move quicker in the water.

If the smooth floating animations are causing distractions or performance issues they can be disabled in the mod-settings.

I made it mostly for my own playthrough but hopefully someone else can get joy from it!

Thank you to llunak for the various performance improvements!
